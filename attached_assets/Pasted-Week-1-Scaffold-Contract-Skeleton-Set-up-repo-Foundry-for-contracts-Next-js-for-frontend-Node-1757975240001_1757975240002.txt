Week 1: Scaffold & Contract Skeleton
Set up repo (Foundry for contracts, Next.js for frontend, Node.js for indexer/relayer).


Write base Mixer.sol with deposit() + withdraw() placeholders.


Add Ownable, Pausable, ReentrancyGuard (OpenZeppelin).


Deploy on local testnet (Anvil).


Deliverable: Local chain demo: deposit → locked → withdraw (no delay logic yet).

Week 2: Add Time Lock & Pools
Implement per-pool configuration: Pool A (6h), Pool B (24h), Pool C (72h).


Store the deposit timestamp/block in mapping.


Enforce block.timestamp >= depositTime + poolDelay.


Write Foundry tests for delay enforcement.


Deliverable: Contracts that enforce time-locked withdrawals per pool on Sepolia.

Week 3: Fees & Privacy Fund
Add a fee parameter (e.g., 0.3%) on deposits or withdrawals.


Route fees into a privacy fund.


Implement a function to view fund balance (future redistribution).


Test fee deduction logic.


Deliverable: Verified fee logic on Sepolia, balances tracked correctly.

Week 4: Frontend Integration
Build Deposit UI (connect wallet → pick pool → deposit).


Build Withdraw UI (select eligible pool, fresh address, claim after delay).


Show a countdown timer until funds are withdrawable.


Warn if the pool has a low anonymity set.


Deliverable: Working dApp where users can deposit & see a countdown until eligible to withdraw.

Week 5: Relayer & Security Checks
Implement a basic relayer (Node.js) to submit withdrawal transactions on behalf of users.


Add max deposit size, max pool size in the contract.


Internal audit + fuzz tests for reentrancy/double-withdraw.


Deliverable: Relayer-enabled withdrawals, contracts tested for abuse scenarios.

Week 6: Testnet Beta & Audit Prep
Deploy 3 pools on Sepolia(eth test network) (6h, 24h, 72h delays).


Invite test users to try deposits/withdrawals.


Collect feedback on UX/privacy score.


Prepare audit request (scope: deposits, withdrawals, timelock, fees, relayer).


Deliverable: Testnet beta live with documentation + audit-ready code.
